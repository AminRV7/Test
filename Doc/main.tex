\textbf{Abstract}\\
\par In this dissertation, we report and analyze the results of applying an iterative heuristic that uses piecewise linear (PWL) functions for approximating nonlinear objective functions and constraints. Specifically, we focus on quadratic programming and quadratically constrained programming problems with a nonlinear separable objective function of multiple variables. Each iteration solves a PWL optimization approximation to the separable problem. We compare the performance of the heuristic against that of three other solvers: CPLEX, BARON, \& IPOPT on a large set of difficult randomly generated instances. We also compare our heuristic with the usual PWL approach to separable programming, where the breakpoints of the PWL functions are equally distributed for each variable. The computational results indicate that the heuristic performs considerably better in either case, both in terms of objective function value and computational time.
